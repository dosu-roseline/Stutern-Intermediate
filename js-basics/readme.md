Question one - What runs JavaScript outside the browser ?
JavaScript can be run outside of the browser by using a runtime environment like Node.js, which allows JavaScript to be executed on the server-side.

Question Two - Name 5 things Javascript can do.
i - Manipulate HTML and CSS to dynamically update the content and styling of a webpage.
ii - Handle user events like mouse clicks and keyboard input to create interactive user interfaces.
iii - Make HTTP requests to APIs and databases to retrieve and send data to a server.
iv - Create animations and effects to enhance the visual experience of a webpage.
v - Validate user input to ensure that forms and other data collection methods contain valid and complete information.

Question Three - When was ECMAScript first released ?
June 1997

Question Four - How do you log to the console?
console.log() method.
E.g console.log("Hello, world!");

Question Five - List the tech fields that use JavaScript, for example FrontEnd.
i - Front-end web development: JavaScript is a fundamental language for building interactive web applications, including dynamic user interfaces and responsive design.

ii - Back-end web development: JavaScript can be used with Node.js and other back-end frameworks to build web servers, APIs, and other server-side applications.

iii - Mobile app development: JavaScript can be used with frameworks like React Native and Ionic to build cross-platform mobile applications.

iv - Desktop application development: JavaScript can be used with Electron and other frameworks to build desktop applications.

v - Game development: JavaScript can be used with frameworks like Phaser and Babylon.js to build games for the web and other platforms.

vi - Internet of Things (IoT): JavaScript can be used to build software for IoT devices and smart appliances.

vii - Machine learning and data science: JavaScript can be used with libraries like TensorFlow.js and ml5.js to build machine learning models and data visualization tools in the browser.

Question Six - Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
Statically typed languages require the programmer to declare the data type of a variable at the time of its creation and enforce strict typing rules throughout the program. This means that the data type of a variable cannot be changed at runtime. Examples of statically typed languages include:

i - C++
ii - Java
iii - Rust
iv - Swift
v - TypeScript
On the other hand, Dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The data type is inferred at runtime, and the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program. This makes the language more flexible and allows for more concise and readable code. Examples of dynamically typed languages include:

i - JavaScript
ii - Python
iii - Ruby
iv - PHP
v - Lisp

Question Seven - Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined&nbsp;

- undefined is a primitive data type that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but has not been initialized with a value. It can also be returned by a function that does not explicitly return a value.
  For example - let x;
  console.log(x); // Output: undefined

- On the other hand, null is an explicitly assigned value that represents the intentional absence of an object value. It is often used as a placeholder when a variable or property should contain an object, but no object is available or applicable.
  For example - let y = null;
  console.log(y); // Output: null
