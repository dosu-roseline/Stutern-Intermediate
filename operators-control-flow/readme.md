Question Two
Arithmetic Operators:

Addition:
2 + 3 // output: 5,
1.5 + 2.5 // output: 4.

Subtraction:
5 - 2 // output: 3,
4.5 - 1.5 // output: 3.

Multiplication:
2 _ 3 // output: 6,
1.5 _ 2.5 // output: 3.75.

Division:
6 / 3 // output: 2,
10 / 3 // output: 3.3333.

Remainder (Modulus):
7 % 3 // output: 1,
10 % 2 // output: 0.

Increment:
let count = 0; count++; // output: count = 1,
let i = 2; let result = ++i; // output: i = 3 and result = 3.

Decrement:
let count = 2; count--; // output: count = 1,
let i = 5; let result = --i; // output: i = 4 and result = 4.

Assignment Operators:

Assignment:
let x = 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

Addition assignment:
let y = 3; y += 2; assigns the value 5 to the variable y.

Subtraction assignment:
let z = 7; z -= 3; assigns the value 4 to the variable z.

Multiplication assignment:
let a = 4; a \*= 3; assigns the value 12 to the variable a.

Division assignment: let b = 10; b /= 2; assigns the value 5 to the variable b.

Remainder (Modulus) assignment:
let c = 8; c %= 3; assigns the value 2 to the variable c.

Bitwise AND assignment:
let d = 5; d &= 3; assigns the value 1 to the variable d.

Bitwise OR assignment:
let e = 5; e |= 3; assigns the value 7 to the variable e.

Comparison Operators:

Equal to:
2 == '2' // output: true,
'hello' == 'hello' // output: true.

Not equal to:
2 != '3' // output: true,
'hello' != 'world' // output: true.

Strict equal to:
2 === 2 // output: true,
2 === '2' // output: false.

Strict not equal to:
2 !== '3' // output: true,
2 !== 2 // output: false.

Greater than:
5 > 3 // output: true,
10 > 20 // output: false.

Greater than or equal to:
5 >= 5 // output: true,
10 >= 20 // output: false.

Less than:
5 < 10 // output: true,
20 < 10 // output: false.

Less than or equal to:
5 <= 5 // output: true,
20 <= 10 // output: false.

Logical Operators:

Logical AND:
true && false // output: false,
1 > 0 && 'hello' === 'hello' // output: true.

Logical OR:
true || false // output: true,
1 > 0 || 'hello' === 'world' // output: true.

Logical NOT: `!true

Bitwise Operators:

Bitwise AND:
5 & 3 // evaluates to 1 (because 5 is 101 in binary and 3 is 011, so the result is 001)
10 & 6 // evaluates to 2 (because 10 is 1010 in binary and 6 is 0110, so the result is 0010)

Bitwise OR:
5 | 3 // evaluates to 7 (because 5 is 101 in binary and 3 is 011, so the result is 111)
10 | 6 // evaluates to 14 (because 10 is 1010 in binary and 6 is 0110, so the result is 1110)

Bitwise XOR:
5 ^ 3 // evaluates to 6 (because 5 is 101 in binary and 3 is 011, so the result is 110)
10 ^ 6 // evaluates to 12 (because 10 is 1010 in binary and 6 is 0110, so the result is 1100)

Bitwise NOT:
~5 // evaluates to -6 (because the bitwise not of 5, which is 101 in binary, is 010, which is -6 in two's complement notation)
~10 // evaluates to -11 (because the bitwise not of 10, which is 1010 in binary, is 0101, which is -11 in two's complement notation)

Left Shift:
5 << 1 // evaluates to 10 (because 5 is 101 in binary, and shifting the bits to the left by 1 gives 1010, which is 10 in decimal)
10 << 2 // evaluates to 40 (because 10 is 1010 in binary, and shifting the bits to the left by 2 gives 101000, which is 40 in decimal)

Right Shift:
5 >> 1 // evaluates to 2 (because 5 is 101 in binary, and shifting the bits to the right by 1 gives 10, which is 2 in decimal)
10 >> 2 // evaluates to 2 (because 10 is 1010 in binary, and shifting the bits to the right by 2 gives 10, which is 2 in decimal)

Unsigned Right Shift:
5 >>> 1 // evaluates to 2 (because 5 is 101 in binary, and shifting the bits to the right by 1 gives 10, which is 2 in decimal)
-10 >>> 2 // evaluates to 1073741821 (because -10 is represented in two's complement notation, and shifting the bits to the right by 2 gives the value of 1073741821 in decimal)
